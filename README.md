# Technical Test

## Overview

This technical test is a small web application built with React and styled-components. The application allows users to view a profile page for a fictional person named Jake Jones. The profile page includes a photo, job title, and contact information, as well as buttons for calling, getting directions, and sending an email. Users can also add the contact to their address book, and share the page or visit the website. The application supports multiple themes, which can be changed by modifying the URL.

## Installation

To install and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project directory.
3. Start the development server by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can view the profile page for Jake Jones. You can click on the buttons to call, get directions, or send an email, or add the contact to your address book. You can also share the page or visit the website by clicking on the buttons in the footer. To change the theme, you can modify the URL by adding `/theme/:themeId`, where `:themeId` is the ID of the desired theme (e.g. `/theme/2` for the second theme).
